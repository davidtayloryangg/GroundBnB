<!-- Project Overview -->
# <a name="project-overview"></a>Project Overview

Many memorable events occur in a backyard. Barbecues, parties, cockouts, etc. are all things that happen in a backyard. However, many people very rarely use thier backyard and even more unfortunate, many people, especially in cities, do not have a backyard at all. The goal of GroundBnb is to be a revolutinary game changer that allows people who are looking for backyards to use and rent with people who do not use their own backyard. GroundBnb helps homeowners profit off their own backyards while bringing the opportunity for others to enjoy them.
<br>

Customers who have GroundBnB accounts are able to browse backyards to rent while also being able to rent out their own backyards. Comsters can review and rate the backyards they have rented, and customers who list their backyards can thoroughly describe all the features and amenities they can offer. Finally, customers can search by location on what backyard they would like to rent and GroundBnB will display all nearby results that match their criteria.
